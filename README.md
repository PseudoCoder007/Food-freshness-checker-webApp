# 🍎 Food Freshness Checker

> A smart web app that uses **Machine Learning (TensorFlow.js + MobileNet)** to detect whether food is **fresh** or **rotten** based on image uploads.  
> Built with **React**, **Bootstrap**, and a clean **black & red aesthetic** theme — fully deployable on **Vercel**.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Upload fresh & rotten food images as references  
✅ Upload a test image to predict food condition  
✅ Uses **TensorFlow.js MobileNet embeddings** for ML-based comparison  
✅ Includes a **color heuristic** to detect browning or spoilage  
✅ Fully client-side (no backend required)  
✅ Responsive and professionally designed with **Bootstrap**  
✅ Deploy easily with **Vercel**

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Upload a fresh food image** → used as a visual reference.  
2. *(Optionally)* **Upload a rotten image** → helps the model understand what “bad” looks like.  
3. **Upload a test image** → the app analyzes similarity between reference and test images using:
   - MobileNet embeddings (for visual features)
   - Cosine similarity (for comparing image features)
   - Color analysis (to check for dark/brown tones)
4. Combines all results to predict:  
   🟢 **EDIBLE** or 🔴 **NOT EDIBLE**
